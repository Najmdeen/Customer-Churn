# Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview
This project involves building machine learning models to predict customer churn for an Anonymous Multinational Bank. The models predict whether a customer will churn based on various features like credit score, geography, age, balance, and more.

## Models
Two models were trained and evaluated and only two of them are save for testing on Streamlit:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Decision Tree
- Gradient Boosting

## Streamlit App
A Streamlit app is included for easy testing of the saved models. Users can input customer features through the app's interface and receive predictions on churn.

### Running the Streamlit App
To run the app, ensure you have Streamlit installed and then execute the following command in your terminal:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
